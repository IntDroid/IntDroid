All the datasets are derived from a growing collection, AndroZoo (https://androzoo.uni.lu/), which currently contains over eight million different APKs, each of which has been (or will soon be) analysed by several different AntiVirus products in VirusTotal (https://www.virustotal.com/) to know which applications are detected as malware. The datasets used in our experiments can be obtained from AndroZoo through the given sha256 (https://androzoo.uni.lu/api_doc).
