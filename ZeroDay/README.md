In a effort to validate the capability of IntDroid on detecting real-world
zero-day malware, we leverage our 8,253 samples to train a classifier by
using 1NN algorithm. Next, we crawl 5,000 apps from GooglePlay
market and feed them to the trained 1NN classifier. IntDroid is able to discover
28 zero-day malware among 5,000 GooglePlay apps, 1 of them has
been downloaded and installed by more than 10 million users, and
1 of them is not reported as malware by existing tools
